# Survey Data Dashboard (Power BI)

This project visualizes survey responses collected from a diverse group of individuals, transforming raw feedback into meaningful insights. The dashboard is designed to help stakeholders quickly understand patterns in opinions, preferences, and satisfaction levels across different demographics.

## Why I Built This

I wanted to create a dashboard that takes qualitative survey data and makes it easier to interpret through structured visuals. This project helped me sharpen my skills in cleaning categorical data, designing thoughtful visuals, and guiding users toward key takeaways.

## Key Features

- **Demographic Breakdown**: View responses segmented by gender, age group, and country.
- **Question-Level Insights**: Analyze how different groups responded to individual survey questions.
- **Satisfaction Metrics**: Identify patterns in satisfaction levels across various demographics.
- **Filters and Interactivity**: Users can apply slicers to explore responses by region, age, or other custom segments.
- **Clean Layout**: Clear, organized visuals that emphasize comparison and patterns.

## Tools & Skills Used

- **Power BI** – for visualizing categorical and rating-scale data.
- **Data Preparation** – cleaned null values, encoded categorical variables, and reshaped the dataset using Excel and Power Query.
- **DAX** – used calculated fields for grouped averages and percentage comparisons.
- **User Experience** – focused on layout and color choice for better interpretation of survey trends.
